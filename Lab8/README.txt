My inspiration inspired me to add some extra water to the city. I added some extra prefabs to put ponds in parks randomly, as well as changed some of the roads to be canals instead.
I also added some additionaly buildings that could be randomly generated, and found those from an asset pack in the unity store.

My partner did not help me with my lab. At the time of submission he has not responded to my attempts at contacting him.
