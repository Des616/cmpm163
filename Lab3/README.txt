The first cube on the far left is the base normal cube using a Phong Mesh Material, it doesnt really have any special properties added.

The second cube, is based on the interpolation example provided to us, I changed up the colors and then set the interpolation to take place between the x and z axis's as opposed to along the y axis.

The third cube is the three js material cube made out of the MeshToonMaterial. I also added some shininess and made it specular.

The fourth and final cube is just the example cube using interpolation I only edited the colors.
