24 A)   X = floor(u * 7)
   B)   y = 7-floor(v*7)
   C)   (.375,.25) = 2,1 = grey

The first cube on the left is my Cube3, with the new texture and normal map, I used different normal maps, and textures for this one.
The second cube is the cube that does not have a normal map underneath it, just the texture.
The 3rd cube is the same cube as number 2 with the right normal map beneath it.
The 4th cube is the first custom shader, nothing too special.
The 5th cube is the final part iwth a tiling effect on top of it. Honestly, this thigns a mess, I just messed around with all sorts of operations until I got something that looked tiled. I would love some more resources on how to solve this, because i was lost the whole time.
I tried using sin, cos, to get stuff to loop, but that wasnt working out as I envisioned, so really I just tried different operations from the GLSL functions that somebody linked in discord till I got something to resemble the tiled effect.
