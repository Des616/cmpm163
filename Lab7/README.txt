I chose to do Part 1

How I made it:
	1. I followed all the tutorials in the how to in the documentation.
		a. I then created my mountain by dropping my material onto a bunch of capsules and combinig them together to create a more interesting shape. 
	2. I added an extra normal map and texture to the shader graph to make it look more appropriate for the scene.
	3. I created a plane, and textured it with a normal map and a texture to make it look like sand.
	4. I changed the custom shader that we created in the tutorial to primarily flow on other axis, and limited the y changes to make it look more like an oasis/ desert beach.
	5. I added a custom directional light which changes the color of the scene to make it look more like a desert. 
	6. I downloaded free palm tree assets which I scattered around the outsides of the "pool" to give it some extra flavor.


For this lab, my partner was Ryan Mitchell. He had a really cool mountaint that he worked on, and he told me how he worked on it using the unity terrain tool, which was not something I'd seen before.
We did not help each other at all, we just compared projects once we were done.
