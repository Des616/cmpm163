I took my texture that I used for the waterfall and overlayed it onto a circle object as a secondary albedo. Then i tinted the rock green to make it more mossy. 

c) I used a waterfall texture, a base rock texture, and finally a river texture for the base plane. 

d) I added a blue 360 degree skybox that I found on the unity store.
